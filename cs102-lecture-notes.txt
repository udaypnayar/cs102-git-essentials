Here's how we begin the lecture notes:-

git add - used to track (and stage changes made in) certain files
git status - tells us what all files are untracked, what all changes have been made (plus whether they've been staged or not) but not committed, number of commits waiting to be pushed, and so on.
git commit - it commits any staged changes in the local machine
git diff - it lets us know about the details of the unstaged changes that have been made by comparing the current contents of the files with the contents prior to the changes being made.
git push - it merges the committed changes to the server of the repository
